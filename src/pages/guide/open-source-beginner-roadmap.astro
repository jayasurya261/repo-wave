    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-indigo text-gray-700 max-w-none">
      
      <h2>Phase 1: The Basics (Week 1-2)</h2>
      <p>Before you ever touch code, you need to understand the ecosystem.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Learn Git Basics:</strong> Understand <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>branch</code>, and <code>merge</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand GitHub:</strong> Learn what a Repository, Fork, Pull Request, and Issue mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Make a non-code contribution:</strong> Fix a typo in a <code>README.md</code>, translate a document, or improve documentation for your favorite library. It sounds small, but it breaks the ice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 2: Your First Real Issue (Month 1-2)</h2>
      <p>Now that you know the workflow, it's time to write some code.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find "Good First Issues":</strong> Use <a href="/issues" class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800 underline">Repo Wave</a> to filter for beginner-friendly tasks in a language you already know well.</li>
        <li><strong>Read the Contributing Guidelines:</strong> Every good project has a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file. Read it before you start coding; it contains essential setup instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for Help:</strong> If you get stuck setting up the project locally, ask on the issue thread! Maintainers are usually happy to help someone who is genuinely trying.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="text-green-800 font-medium m-0"><strong>Goal:</strong> Get 3 small Pull Requests merged into 3 different repositories. This proves you understand the workflow across different environments.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Phase 3: Becoming a Regular (Month 3-6)</h2>
      <p>Instead of jumping randomly from project to project, settle down.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pick One Project:</strong> Find a project you actively use or love the community of. Focus entirely on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Tackle Harder Issues:</strong> Move away from <code>good first issue</code> labels. Try fixing complex bugs or adding small features (`help wanted` labels).</li>
        <li><strong>Review Other People's Code:</strong> You don't need to be a maintainer to review code! Read through open Pull Requests and test them locally. If they work, leave an approving comment. Maintainers notice this.</li>
        <li><strong>Join the Community:</strong> Join their Discord, Slack, or mailing list. Answer questions from newer users.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 4: Maintainer Status (Year 1+)</h2>
      <p>At this point, you know the codebase inside out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Propose Large Features:</strong> Write RFCs (Request for Comments) proposing major architectural changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Triage Issues:</strong> Help label new bugs, ask users for reproduction steps, and close stale issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Invited:</strong> If you follow Phases 1-3 consistently, maintainers will usually invite you to join the core team to help manage the project!</li>
      </ul>

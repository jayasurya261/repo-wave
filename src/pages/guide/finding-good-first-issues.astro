      <h2>What is a "Good First Issue"?</h2>
      <p>
        Maintainers know that large codebases are intimidating. To help newcomers, they add specific labels to easy bugs, small feature requests, or documentation typos. The most common labels are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>good first issue</code></li>
        <li><code>beginner-friendly</code></li>
        <li><code>help wanted</code></li>
        <li><code>documentation</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 1: Pick a Language You Know</h2>
      <p>
        Don't try to learn a new language <em>and</em> learn open source at the same time. If you know JavaScript, filter for JavaScript repositories. <strong>Repo Wave</strong> makes this simple: use the language filter on the sidebar of our <a href="/issues">Issues page</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Look for Active Repositories</h2>
      <p>
        There is nothing worse than making a Pull Request and waiting 6 months for a reply. Before claiming an issue, check the repository:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>When was the last commit? (Should be within the last month)</li>
        <li>Are there recent merged Pull Requests?</li>
        <li>Do the maintainers respond to issues?</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="text-blue-800 font-medium m-0"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> On Repo Wave, the repository health score automatically calculates this for you. Stick to "Easy" difficulty/high health score repos for your first few PRs.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Step 3: Read the Issue Carefully</h2>
      <p>
        Once you find an issue labeled <code>good first issue</code>, read the description carefully. A well-written issue will tell you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What the bug/feature is.</li>
        <li>Which file needs to be changed.</li>
        <li>How to test the change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the issue only says <em>"Make the button blue"</em> without saying <em>which</em> button or <em>where</em> the file is, it might not be a great first issue unless you're willing to dig around.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4: Stake Your Claim</h2>
      <p>
        Don't just start coding! Someone else might be working on it. Leave a polite comment on the issue:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-gray-300 italic p-4 text-gray-600 rounded-r-lg">
        "Hi! I'm a beginner looking to make my first contribution. Is this issue still available? If so, I would love to work on it!"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you or give you the green light before you spend hours coding.

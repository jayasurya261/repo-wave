      <h2>The Life of a Maintainer</h2>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to understand is that <strong>95% of open-source maintainers are unpaid volunteers</strong> doing this in their free time on nights and weekends. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you submit a Pull Request (PR), they have to read your code, understand your logic, run it locally, verify it doesn't break anything else, and deal with CI/CD pipeline failures. That takes time.
      </p>

      <h2>What Maintainers Look For (The Checklist)</h2>
      <p>If you want your PR merged quickly, make sure you check all of these boxes before hitting submit:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Did you follow the template?</strong>
          Most large repos have a PR template. If you delete it and write "fixed bug", your PR will likely be closed. Fill out the description, testing steps, and checklists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is the scope narrow?</strong>
          If you fix a bug in <code>login.js</code>, do not sneak in formatting changes to <code>navbar.js</code> in the same PR. Maintainers hate reviewing "mega PRs" that touch 40 files for un-related reasons. Keep PRs small and focused.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Did you write tests?</strong>
          If the project uses automated testing for its code, and you submit a new feature without tests, it won't be merged. Maintainers rely on tests to ensure future updates don't break your code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Did you follow the code style?</strong>
          If the repo uses 2 spaces for indentation, don't submit code with 4 spaces. Run their linter before pushing (usually <code>npm run lint</code>).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="text-yellow-800 font-medium m-0"><strong>Empathy is Key:</strong> If a maintainer requests changes, do not argue. Say "Thanks for the feedback, I'll update that!" Make the change, and push. You are a guest in their house.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>How Long Should I Wait?</h2>
      <p>
        If a week goes by with no response, it's perfectly fine to leave a polite comment: <em>"Hi @maintainer, just pinging this to see if there is anything I need to change for it to be reviewed. Thanks!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If no one responds after a month, the project might be abandoned. Move on to a healthier, more active repository!
